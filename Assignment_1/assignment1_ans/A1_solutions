Questions
---------

       1.  How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

 ANS:	
	   The declarations in GIMPLE are one per line unlike in the simple code. Multiple 
	   variables declared and initialized on the same line in the sample code is declared 
           on separate lines in GIMPLE. The globle declaration of [int Z] is disappeared and 
	   its value is preserved to be used and for using its value it must be first loaded from locals.


       2.  How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?
ANS:
	  Temperory variables are used to breakdown computational complex expressions.
	  Temporary variables can be used when  there is an operation as an intermediate computation.


       3.  How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
ANS:
	   Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation in GIMPLE.
	   An explicit cast is inserted when a float/double is assigned to an interger.

      4.   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?	
ANS:
	   Reads/writes are performed through the stores from the locals. A temporary is used 
	   for the statement Z=Z+1 because the value of Z+1 
	   can not be stored at the memory location of Z directly, which is not the 
	   case in [q=Z] or [Z=p].
